# Squad-Generator-AK

## Description
This project is a lightweight program that selects Arknights operators for a squad of up to 12.
It reads data about characters from a dataset, calculates probability weights based on assigned objective and subjective scores, and then selects a character at random, but with bias according to the computed probabilities. The agent factors in the operator's role and will attempt to have at least one of each role if the squad is large enough. 

It can generate one or multiple random character selections depending on the number specified by the user.
